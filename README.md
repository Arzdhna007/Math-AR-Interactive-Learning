# 🧮 Math AR – Interactive Augmented Reality Math Learning App

An **Augmented Reality (AR)** educational game designed to help **elementary school students** learn geometry interactively through 3D visualizations.  
Developed with **Unity**, **Vuforia**, and **C#**, this project transforms conventional math learning into a fun and immersive experience.

---

## 📖 Overview
**Math AR** is an educational app that teaches basic geometry—introducing solid and flat shapes like cubes, spheres, prisms, and pyramids—through interactive 3D models displayed via AR markers.  
The app was developed as an innovation in early mathematics education to enhance student engagement and conceptual understanding.

The research and development followed the **ADDIE model** (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation).

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a game-based learning media that makes math more engaging and fun.  
- Improve conceptual understanding of geometry through **AR-based visualization**.  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of AR learning for early-grade students.

---

## 🧩 Features
- 🧠 **3D Object Visualization** – Display and manipulate solid shapes (cube, prism, cone, sphere).  
- 🧮 **Interactive Learning Mode** – Students can rotate, scale, and explore each shape.  
- 🧾 **Formulas and Labels** – Includes area, perimeter, and edge information for every shape.  
- 🧩 **AR Marker Integration** – Scan printed cards to show 3D models in real-world context.  
- 🧠 **Exploration and Quiz** – Encourage students to learn by exploring and testing knowledge.  
- 🎧 **Audio Narration** – Assists younger learners in understanding instructions.  
- 📱 **Offline Ready** – Fully functional without an internet connection.

## 🧭 Development Process (ADDIE Model)

1. **Analysis:**  
   Identified low engagement in traditional math learning and lack of interactive visual tools.
2. **Design:**  
   Created flowcharts, storyboards, and user interface mockups for 3D exploration.
3. **Development:**  
   Built using Unity + Vuforia; implemented object animation and formula visualization.
4. **Implementation:**  
   Tested with students in real classroom environments.
5. **Evaluation:**  
   Used questionnaires and observation to measure user satisfaction and comprehension improvement.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- **Alpha Testing:**  
  Conducted by subject and media experts, evaluating design, usability, and material accuracy.  
- **Blackbox Testing:**  
  Verified all menu interactions (audio, AR trigger, object selection) work as intended.  
- **Student Observation:**  
  Measured student response, participation, and comprehension levels.  
- **Result:**  
  Rated **“Very Good”** in interactivity and visual engagement, proven to improve learning motivation.
